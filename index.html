	<h2>Career Timeline</h2>
	<section class="timeline">
		<h3 class="tl-heading">'07</h3>
		<ul>
			<li class="tl-left">
				<div class="tl-content content-lg">
					Finished my associate's degree with a digital photography/Photoshop course and a graphic design course.
				</div> 
			</li>
			<li class="tl-right">
				<div class="tl-content">
					Purchased a book for a few bucks to learn HTML and built my first website
				</div>
			</li>
			<li class="tl-left">
				<div class="tl-content tl-content-lg">
					Realized why the book was just a few bucks. Tech moves fast so it was terribly out of date. Scratch that table-based HTML.
				</div>
			</li>
			<li class="tl-right">
				<div class="tl-content">
					Learned CSS and re-built my first website. Also studied PHP and Javascript.
				</div>
			</li>
			<li class="tl-left">
				<div class="tl-content tl-content-lg">
					Gained Photoshop experience by cutting out lots and lots of hats from their background in Photoshop - rock on, pen tool!
				</div>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h3 class="tl-heading">'08</h3>
		<ul>
			<li class="tl-right">
				<div class="tl-content">
					Intro to CMSs and Firebug. Whoa, tools!
				</div>
			</li>
			<li class="tl-left">
				<div class="tl-content tl-content-lg">
					Began my Freelance career - web design, maintenance, data entry, and converting static mockups into code, slowly mastering CSS and IE6 compatibility (and as frustrating as IE6 was, I have to admit I enjoyed the challenge).
				</div>
			</li>
			<li class="tl-right">
				<div class="tl-content tl-content-lg">
					Designed websites by creating mockups in Photoshop for blogs, small businesses, and startups, creating custom graphics along the way, and gaining a feel for what works and what doesn't when putting together web layouts.
				</div>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h3 class="tl-heading">'09</h3>
		<ul>
			<li class="tl-left">
				<div class="tl-content tl-content-lg">
					Dug into custom Wordpress theming. Developed a simple starter theme as I built themes for my own personal projects and for new clients - skills which expanded into tackling tough theme and plugin customizations for clients, and for more obscure CMSs.
				</div>
			</li>
			<li class="tl-right">
				<div class="tl-content tl-content-lg">
					Remember that table-based HTML I mistakenly learned? Came in handy when creating custom email newsletter templates that worked in various email clients (Outlook, anyone?). 
				</div>
			</li>
			<li class="tl-left">
				<div class="tl-content tl-content-lg">
					Got deeper into UI/UX design doing work for startups. Found a strength in pinpointing areas of confusion - in the flow of the site, the ways features worked, language used, and in the layout and design. 
				</div>
			</li>
			<li class="tl-right">
				<div class="tl-content tl-content-lg">
					Began working closely with backend developers to integrate the frontend to match my designs. Introduction to version control. Coding strengths realized: I wrote clean code fast and could dig into source files to work CSS magic without messing things up.
				</div>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h3 class="tl-heading">'11</h3>
		<ul>
			<li class="tl-left">
				<div class="tl-content">
					Began working with an agency serving mid-size businesses. Picked up organizational skills and an ability to juggle priorities - design, development, timeline, budget, and varying opinions. Strength in finding compromises to keep a high level of quality while satisfying the client's core requirements and preferences. 
				</div>
			</li>
			<li class="tl-right">
				<div class="tl-content">
					New challenge: responsive design! The most fun challenge yet. Introduced responsive design to the agency I worked with and I became the go-to-gal for converting a regular website to a responsive one. 
				</div>
			</li>
			<li class="tl-right">
				<div class="tl-content">
					Similar projects being designed and built to solve similar problems over and over again.. I started putting more thought into documenting, and abstracting my code for easy re-use and customization for future projects.
				</div>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h3 class="tl-heading">'14</h3>
		<ul>
			<li class="tl-left">
				<div class="tl-content">
					Got my first full-time job at Learning A-Z. Goodbye freelance, hello benefits!
				</div>
			</li>
			<li class="tl-right">
				<div class="tl-content">
					Gained a new understanding of the importance of documentation and maintainability, and more in-depth experience with version control. 
				</div>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h3 class="tl-heading">'15</h3>
		<ul>
			<li class="tl-left">
				<div class="tl-content">
					Developed an obsession for documentation, structure, and consistency, resulting in the creation of a styleguide to kick off an ongoing team HTML/CSS codebase cleanup. Thought more about color pallettes, visual patterns, naming conventions, and architecture than ever before. 
				</div>
			</li>
			<li class="tl-right">
				<div class="tl-content">
					Gained expertise in UI design, creating wireframes for new features and overhauling existing ones. Sketching with OneNote on a Surface Pro and Adobe XD became my wireframing/prototyping tools of choice.
				</div>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h3 class="tl-heading">'16</h3>
		<ul>
			<li class="tl-left">
				<div class="tl-content">
					With the support of my company, went back to school! One year at the University of Michigan to push myself to a new level of technical knowledge. Coding with C++, I learned better documentation using RMEs, got very comfortable with functions, loops, arrays, abstraction using Classes, linked lists, recursion, binary trees, memory management, command line (yes I neglected to learn that in the past).
				</div>
			</li>
			<li class="tl-right">
				<div class="tl-content">
					Continuing the journey! Learning more advanced Javascript, Angular, modular CSS approaches, performance, mobile-first design. Wireframing and prototyping techniques, user testing. And always obsessing about whitespace, alignment, color usage, and consistency. I'm pretty sure "consistency" has become the most-used word in my career.
