    <div class="caseStudy_content">                	    
        <p>After 10 years of Learning A-Z growing fast, adding new features, and acquiring new products, the UI and CSS codebase were fragile and unruly with files thousands of lines long and full of repetition, inconsistencies, and tangled spaghetti code that was clearly reflected in the UI. After some initial team meetings to kick off the project, I got to work putting together a new CSS codebase and styleguide.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<h3>Process</h3>

<hr />

<div class="caseStudy_row">
    <div class="caseStudy_headingContainer">
        <h4>Plan & Implement</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="caseStudy_content">   

        <p>Initially, the styleguide was built based on SMACSS principles and included a grid system and generic UI components and helpers. After some revisions with the team, the new CSS began being introduced into new projects. Then came the painstaking process of updating the legacy code.</p>

        <p>My process was to first take stock of what exists on the sites (buttons, for example)</p>

        <br /><img style="display: inline-block; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/portfolio/raz/btn1.png" />
        <img style="display: inline-block; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/portfolio/raz/btn2.png" />
        <img style="display: inline-block; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/portfolio/raz/btn3.png" />
        <img style="display: inline-block; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/portfolio/raz/btn4.png" />
        <img style="display: inline-block; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/portfolio/raz/btn6.png" />
        <img style="display: inline-block; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/portfolio/raz/btn7.png" />
        <img style="display: inline-block; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/portfolio/raz/btn8.png" />
        <img style="display: inline-block; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/portfolio/raz/btn9.png" />
        <img style="display: inline-block; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/portfolio/raz/btn10.png" />
        <img style="display: inline-block; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/portfolio/raz/btn11.png" />
        <img style="display: inline-block; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/portfolio/raz/btn12.png" />
        <img style="display: inline-block; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/portfolio/raz/btn13.png" />
        <img style="display: inline-block; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/portfolio/raz/btn14.png" />
        <img style="display: inline-block; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/portfolio/raz/btn15.png" />
        <img style="display: inline-block; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/portfolio/raz/btn16.png" /><br /><br />
        
        <p>Next I needed to find a unified approach that would work for all scenarios without requiring controversial change that would lead to a longer approval process. For example, if there were 3 green buttons, I would pick a good green and use it consistently everywhere, but wouldn\'t change green to orange without good reason. Once an approach was approved, I wrote HTML/CSS following new guidelines in the styleguide, and implemented it page by page. </p>

        <p>Once everything was cleaned up and consistent, it was much easier to make more dramatic change moving forward, such as removing icons or changing colors.</p>

        <p>As changes were rolled out, one problem that surfaced was the over-use of helpers. The same complicated patterns of helper classes were being repeated over and over in a huge number of files. The need for a more module-based approach became clear, leading us to adopt BEM, slightly modified to suit work we had already done with the looser SMACSS method. I updated the styleguide with clear definitions for the new modular approach.</p>

    <div class="caseStudy_content"> 
        <p>On the Learning A-Z family of sites, teachers can <b>save books</b> and other resources inside of a File Cabinet for future use. They can also <b>assign books</b> for students to complete online.</p> 
        <p>I was assigned <b>two new projects</b> related to the File Cabinet and Assignments:</p> 
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>Redesign the File Cabinet</b>, including new functionality for teachers to share their collections
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Enhance the Assignments feature</b> to Design a way for teachers to create assignments with multiple books, and save them for future use
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>I knew the features that needed to be added, but <b>didn't know the 'why'</b>. What types of teachers was this for? What are some representative scenarios for how they might use this feature? Nonetheless, I was instructed to move ahead, and took on the challenge from more of an architectural standpoint.</p>

        <h3>Analysis</h3> 
    </div> 
    <div class="caseStudy_content">
        <p>When the features were described to me, it sounded like <b>2 versions of the same feature</b>. I wrote up a simple diagram to think this through and demonstrate my point.</p>

        <img class="border border-5" style="width: 500px;" src="images/portfolio/raz/fileCabinet-diagram.png" /> 
            
        <p>Both features were ways for teachers to <b>collect and organize resources</b>. I suggested one unified project so that teachers aren't collecting resources in two different places.</p> 

        <hr />

        <p>Next, I had to think about what sort of UI might support flows for browsing, collecting, saving, assigning, and sharing. The process sounded a lot like the familiar <b>ecommerce experiences</b> of finding items, adding them to wishlists and shopping carts, and completing purchases. I did some more diagramming to think this through.</p>

        <img class="border border-5" style="width: 500px;" src="images/portfolio/raz/fileCabinet-diagram2.png" />
        
        <p>After demonstrating the strong correlation, shopping cart experiences became a big source of reference and inspiration for the File Cabinet and Assignments.</p>

        <h3>Information Architecture</h3>

    <div class="caseStudy_content">

        <p>Before beginning any layouts, I needed to <b>map out the features</b> to better understand the requirements, and <b>how they fit together</b>.</p>

        <p>First, I started with the known sitemap, and added the necessary interactions for each page.</p>

        <img class="border border-5" src="images/portfolio/raz/fileCabinet-userflow2.png" />

        <p>Then, I <b>reorganized the map</b> by the sequences of actions users can take.</p>

        <img class="border border-5" src="images/portfolio/raz/fileCabinet-userflow3.png" />

        <p>From this process, <b>4 project components</b> emerged:</p>

            <li>File Cabinet</li> 
            <li>File Cabinet Preview</li>

        <p>At this point, the numerous <b>assumptions</b> and lack of research and clear use cases <b>began to catch up to us</b>. Feedback from the product team was that it needed to be easier to assign a collection of resources on the spot. Saving this collection for later was a secondary priority. Once again, <b>the 'why' was not understood</b>. It was explained simply as a feature the market was asking for. I moved forward with the assumption that this was correct, and <b>mockups were reworked</b> to satisfy this new requirement.</p>
        
        <p>A ribbon was used to allow teachers to actively see their collection being built, and the button labeling was changed so that it didn't feel like a feature primarily for saving collections.</p>

            A <b>similar design process</b> was followed to design screens for <b>creating and managing assignments, and monitoring assignment progress</b>.

        <p>To help organize the chaos, I documented each mockup and requirement, providing a single source of truth to maintain alignment among design, engineering, QA, and product teams as much as possible, and to track changes and progress as they occurred.</p>

However, there was still much work to be done to tie these features together. But many steps were taken in the right direction, resulting in a more useful experience for teachers.</p> 
                
        <p>Throughout the project, I made an effort to understand exactly what the priority was - <b>what problems were we trying to solve?</b> What were the key scenarios we wanted to design for? Were our users primarily elementary teachers, or reading specialists? Unfortunately <b>I failed to collect this information</b>, and relied on assumptions and heresay to make decisions and move forward. This project was clear evidence that skipping steps and making assumptions hurts everyone, including our users. I was proud of my ability to step up and help organize the project, but learned the <b>importance of advocating more strongly for design thinking</b>.</p>

        <p>After initial meetings with the new scrum team, everyone was struggling to wrap our minds around what we were trying to create. </p>

        <p>My first contribution was putting together a <b>simple sitemap</b> to help get everyone on the same page.</p>

        <p>Our project manager and scrum master introduced us to the concept of story mapping. I worked closely with her and the product owner to fill out the storymap, which became a sort of hybrid between a <b>storymap and a flow</b>.</p>

Mockups included the teacher's experience finding and using <b>lesson plans</b> on the site, assigning them to students, and also the student experience completing lessons using the <b>digital writing tool</b>. In addition, we needed to consider <b>how the teacher would use the digital writing tool to write with the class.</b></p>

        <p>Mockups went through <b>multiple iterations</b> to reach the point shown here, but because of the careful and thorough background work, the first round of mockups was close, and further iterations served to help us narrow the scope and refine details. This was an example of how a <b>good exploration phase can lead to a successful design phase!</b></p>

        <h3>Prototypes and User Testing</h3> 
    </div> 
    <div class="caseStudy_content">

        <p>At this point, we needed to get some questions answered, and gut check many assumptions with <b>user testing</b>. The initial testing was focused on the big picture - would teachers understand the product? Would they want to use it? Basically - <b>were we building the right product?</b></p>

        <p>Because this line of questioning was very product-focused, the product owner took ownership of this round of testing. We were very pleased to find that teachers immediately <b>recognized the lesson structure, and how the digital tools were intended to be used</b>. They invisioned using it in their classroom and were excited by what they saw. We wouldn't know for sure until teachers truly tried it out with their class, but the <b>initial feedback was very encouraging</b>.</p>

        <p>Next, the UX team completed more <b>detailed testing</b> to narrow down some of the UI decisions we needed to make. I provided <b>prototypes and questions</b>, and another UX team member completed testing for this project alongside the other Next Gen product that was being developed. This testing was surrounding issues like <b>navigation, information architecture, and the hierarchy of information</b>. A few quick tests were very helpful in <b>refining details</b> we were waffling on for our beta version of the Next Gen products, and helping us find blind spots. Fortunately, <b>no major issues were found</b>.</p>

        <h3>Development</h3> 
    </div> 
    <div class="caseStudy_content">

        <p>One of my primary focuses with the Next Gen projects was <b>maintaining alignment across teams</b>. This included the work shown above, a lot of ongoing work to coordinate with the other Next Gen product team, and <b>close collaboration with our engineers</b>. As the deadline for our <b>beta release</b> kept getting closer, we needed to understand <b>what tools would be used</b> to build the site, which features were realistic for our timeline, and <b>which features needed to be simplified</b> or adjust to keep them in scope.</p>

        <p>The engineering team had decided to start fresh with the Next Gen sites rather than re-using old problematic code built on AngularJS. The new products would be built with an updated version of <b>Angular using Angular Material</b>. Time was going to be extremely tight for development, so after carefully studying Angular Material, the <b>mockups were adjusted to match out-of-the-box Angular Material</b>. This didn't look ideal, but <b>gave a very clear pictures of what could be accomplished within the timeframe we had</b>. Creating a subpar page layout was much preferred over setting up the team to rush and write hundreds of lines of spaghetti styles which would land us in the same mess we were in with our legacy code. This helped ensure that everyone on the team understood what we were doing, and why.</p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3> 
    </div> 
    <div class="caseStudy_content">

        <p>As the beta design phase wrapped up and development began, I left Learning A-Z for a position with another company. As of this writing (7/22), Next Gen Writing still hasn't been launched, so I can't share any final results.</p>

        <p>This project was a <b>great example of teamwork, and following process</b>. Instead of thinking to myself "if only I could talk to so and so... if only we would stick to a process... if only..." we did it right. With our project manager advocating strongly for scrum processes, and a new sprint team, and a team of people willing and eager to learn better ways of doing things and wanting to make an awesome product, I was able to tackle the UX in the right way - by <b>understanding the background, working closely with the product team, content editors, instructional designers, developers, and other UX designers</b>. It was a very stressful time, but very rewarding to put in effort to do things right, and see it start to pay off.</p>
