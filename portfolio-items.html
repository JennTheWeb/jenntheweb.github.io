                <div class="caseStudy_content">
                    <p>On the Learning A-Z family of sites, teachers can save resources they like inside of a File Cabinet for future use, and create assignments for students to complete online.</p>
                    <p>I was asked to redesign the File Cabinet and plan feature enhancements for sharing and assigning. </p>

                    <p>Initially, the File Cabinet and Assignments were  presented to me as separate projects. But I sensed a lot of overlap between the two projects, so I wrote out a simple hand-drawn diagram to think this through.</p>

                    <br /><img class="frame" style="width: 500px;" src="images/portfolio/raz/fileCabinet-diagram.png" /><br />
                        
                    <p>I suggested one unified project to allow teachers to collect, organize, and the project moved forward in this way.</p>

                    <p>The described process of finding something, assigning it now, or saving it for later sounded a lot like a shopping cart and wishlist experience, so I did some more diagramming again to think this through.</p>+

                    <p>After demonstrating the strong correlation, shopping cart experiences became a big source of reference and inspiration for the assigning process.</p>

                    <p>The project had evolved into a large complex one, and it seemed to change every day as new requirements and feedback came to light. I began to document each mockup and requirement in a shared document to keep everyone on the same page. This evolved into a 50+ page document used by design, engineering, and management to communicate and track changes and completion of features. This was accompanied by user flow diagrams and prototypes.</p>

                    <p>In the end, teachers were able to assign groups of resources with just a few clicks, easily view those collections in the File Cabinet, and monitor progress on the Assignments page, so the project was considered a success. However, there was still much work to be done to tie these features together which was out of the scope of this project. But many steps were taken in the right direction, resulting in a more useful experience for teachers.</p>

                    <p>Throughout the project, as feature changes got out of control, effort was made to understand exactly what the priority was - what problem were we trying to solve? Did we want it to be easy for teachers to plan lessons, or to save their favorites? Did we want to optimize the experience for resource detail pages, or category pages? Did we want to focus on ease of use, or advanced lesson planning? Elementary teachers, or reading specialists? As the saying goes, if you design for everyone, you design for no one. Never have I felt the truth of that saying more than while working on this project. But there was a lot to be proud of, and a lot learned about UX, development, and project management, and the need to advocate for design-centric thinking. </p>
